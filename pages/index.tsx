            - I was born and raised in Vancouver, Canada where I grew to love
            the mountains, especially skiing and hiking. After university I
            moved to Toronto shifting my attention to different interests -
            namely eating and drinking. I'm back on the west coast these days,
            but not sure where I'll be settling in the near future. - My
            educational background is in business, however I've worked as a PM,
            designer, and developer. Most recently, I was the co-founder and
            technology lead of a software consulting business focused on CRM
            technologies with a few long-time friends, however we've just exited
            the business. - I'm passionate about learning/education, technology,
            and behaviour (especially behavioural economics). - I read a fair
            amount (mostly non-fiction) and I'm always looking to discuss books
            if anyone is interested! My most recent reads: When Breathe Becomes
            Air, Dune, Seveneves, Think Again, and Thinking in Bets.
