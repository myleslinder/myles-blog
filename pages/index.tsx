              I was born and raised in Vancouver, Canada where I grew to love
              the mountains, especially skiing and hiking. After university I
              moved to Toronto shifting my attention to different interests -
              namely eating and drinking.

              I'm currently living in Vancouver, but I'm not sure where I'll be
              settling in the near future. My educational background is in
              business, however I've worked as a PM, designer, and developer.

              Most recently, I was the co-founder and technology lead of a
              software consulting business focused on CRM technologies with a
              few long-time friends. I'm passionate about learning/education,
              technology, and behaviour (especially behavioural economics).
