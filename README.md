## GPT-3 Chatbot in Hero

GPT-3-Me chat bot in hero - has ability for chatter to put in name and make a little avatar thats a color picker and emoji selector (like i built in that movie app)

- will need a UI for the back and forth chat (just steal intercom basically)
- will need my avatar (just image?)
- will need the avatar selector and info input modal
- will need the color picker and emoji selector
- will need to train the GPT-3
- will need to connect to and use GPT-3

**so this might be impossible because this use case wouldn't be approved with GPT-3 for more than 5 people**

could instead do something using the word of the day - get word of day from an api feed it to gpt-3 to say something cool with it
