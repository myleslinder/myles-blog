# My Personal Site

## TODO

### Organization

- organize public folder moving everything into a sub static folder
- move everything into src folder
- set up alias in tsconfig and adjust imports

### Development

- get eslint set up as hooks rules aren't working right now
- add readme and a few other things to an ignore so no deployment on change
- tests, jest + cypress (see bl repo + [starter](https://github.com/joelhooks/next-typescript-tailwind-mdx-starter))

### Feats

- custom 404 page
- sitemap and seo considerations
- accessibility
  -animation on color scheme change (ensure handle prefers-reduced-motion)
