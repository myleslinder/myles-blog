Using notion api for posts instead? That might be fun but I really prefer the simple markdown and MDX

fun things:

- spotify what iâ€™m listening to + stats
- github stats
- twitter?
- exercise stats of some kind here would be cool
- books as well
- the new words thing is kind of fun
- unanswered questions (or topics) similar to patrick collison

- light mode and dark mode (with system option)

- an email service where i can send on the go tils or notes that will make a branch add to the file or make one then have a way to clean these up when back on desktop

### Sections

Projects
Employment
Hobbies
Blog
Spotify Listening + Popular (any other cool stats I can show like wrapped style?)
Books? Library

### Ideas

Could use either Notion or MDX as the blog source or even Obsidian?
Twitter has an API and I wonder if I get could get my bookmarks from it?
a day/night animation in hero for my time or local time of viewer
