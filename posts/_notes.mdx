would need to remind people of what happens every time you pop-up basically

show the physical equivalent of the carbon offset per transaction (or for total transactions) using something like trees
allow people to do the offset as a 'guest' - so no need for account
also let them create an account (what is account incentive?) - could offer 'social' logins for ease
with account you could do something similar to amazon smile where you let people make some kind of usage choice once they have an account

- you could also have a way to let brands 'match' offsets which is kind of like a form of eco concious brand advertising as you showcase that brand, difficult though as you couldn't 'pair up' competitors

chrome and the shitty extension ecosystem situation is a pretty sizable risk (other browsers need to be supported too)

how would you track transaction conversion?
how would you deal with potential lost state on the needed refresh for augmenting the url?

how would you deal with the difficulty in getting extensions exposed as with new chrome they're hidden upon add?
would you need to show the extension icon itself or because you're running on every page could you throw a toast-like thing in there? think intercom bubble

how would you determine the proper offset value? I guess it's just what the affiliate value is
different sites handle affiliates differently so would you ask upon initial page load of any url for a matching partner?
or would you wait until the checkout stage in the case that they don't carry an affiliation through the entire session?
how would you handle sessions generally? would you 'remember' someones preferences for a site in the case they visit it again? if you did you would need to have a way to manage that - although the trade off of not having to ask every time might be worth it

how would you deal with mobile? similar question to the need for other browser extensions - you could potentially have an ios/android 'share sheet extension' that lets you deal with it somehow?

what do i want to do?

I shouldn't ask a question like that as it's far too large, I need to ask a smaller version of the question.
So let's start by teasing it apart:

- what industries interest me?
- what activities from past job/work have I enjoyed?
  - I have fond memories of being at brainstation and looking at the data and then making decisions about to what build next using that data
  - I enjoyed having a perspective and knowledge about the industry
  - I like working with designers to come up with how you should interact with what we're building
- are there any aspects of previous jobs that I liked?
- are there any activities that elicit a feeling I want more of?
  - flow state
  - problem solving
-

- why do i not feel excited at the prospect of speccing out my own project as practice?

  - it feels tedious, I want to discuss it - i'm disinterested in the act of archiving and documenting the bland specifics
  - I feel as if the portion of 'why' wont be able to be addressed because the answer is just 'i want it and i think it would be fun to make'
    - its interesting that i say 'fun to make' there where if it really were going to be fun I would have done it
      - I did enjoy the act of doing the design and I did make a super high level spec in obsidian
      - I think about the post that I was writing about the enhanced playlists and I think I was able to
        have a somewhat informed opinion about the feature but I also felt like it was a foggy (unclear)
        opinion that wouldn't reflect 100% understanding and so might come off poorly.

- its also interesting to note that the flow state, problem solving, and act of creation were the things I enjoy most about dev
- I don't think im instrinsically interested in the internals of the technology itself (although I seem to get bogged down under the assumption that this is critical knowledge, because i for some reason deem it as being necessary to be "the best").
  - I also don't seem to care for the things that make 'software engineering' like testing and writing things that "scale", etc
  - Essentially I only care about betas or MVPs etc of the "development" side as a developer, like I don't care about cross browser testing or whatever, I just care about it doing the thing in a technical happy path situation.
- What makes me not think about doing pm as the right pursuit? is it fear of failure? when i think about my job at bs before i was jaded i really liked the work I was doing - although there are some segments i dont think i really liked, like i hate project management - its really for some reason i was just checked out

salary expectations

why are you interested in the role

- im interested in helping to shape, define, and deliver a dope ass learning platform
- i'm a definition lifelong learner, taught myself to code (using online courses),
- im just generally interested in learning new things and helping others learn new things
- for me its a bit of a funny intersection because 'how to best learn' is something i enjoy learning about most (how meta)
- I also understand the importance of digital skills both as a contributor (career advancement) and for the company employees (worked with over 100 businesses who could have benefited tremendously from additional digital skills)
  How do you see the future of education? What learning platform do you find inspiring?
- future of ed
  - The future of education is about accessibility, data, and taking advantage of being online-first.
  - accessible to anyone anywhere
  - ## with online learning we have such incredible opportunity to use data to shape as effective a learning environment as possible
- learning platform find inspiring
  - Execute program
  - The SRS implementation is amazing and works very well
  - no shortcuts with regard to quick wins vs doing the actual things that will force you to learn
  - you can also feel the level of care put into it.

What are the three biggest (most relevant) weaknesses you have in relation to this role? How will you address them?

- in no particular order
- 1. I can overextend myself at work offering myself to too many intiatives reducing my ability to execute as effectively. In a previous job this manifested with a nearly full calendar of meetings each day.
- 2. Imposter syndrome.
- 3. overanalysis.
- 4. quite direct with my feedback.
- 5. shy
     Where would you like to direct your professional growth in the next 1-2 years?
- In 5 years I want to be running a PMO? So i want to orient my growth over the next 1-2 years toward improving the practice of product management at the organization I work for.
- I'm also drawn to strategic work and am keen to continue to grow with regards to overarching strategic decision making
