title: Spotify Enhanced Playlists
description: Thoughts on the 'Enhanced Playlists' feature Spotify recently A/B tested in certain markets

This a way to turn user generated playlists into a algo-driven distribution editorial
Spotify is effectively turning user-generated playlists into another distribution channel while at the same time accelerating new user stickiness and increasing switching costs for existing users. When I refer to it as a distribution channel it's important to note that Spotify really distributes discovery, they're adding discovery to your space - and doing it in a way that is push-based, as opposed to pull.

In the Spotify podcast they talk about an ecommerce example where ML can allow for an ecommerce business to move from a shop-then-ship model to a ship-then-shop model. This is exactly that for playlist based discovery - they ship songs into your playlist that you then shop from and decide what to keep - whereas the old model is more like "customers who bought this also like" feature that still relies on you shopping for what you want then having it shipped to you (added to your playlist).

### Outline

1. Explain what Spotify enhanced playlists are and the background on the situation
2. Discuss the possible reasons why enhanced playlists might exist
3. Elaborate on each of the possible reasons in turn
   1. discuss what exists or is missing that would make this the main reason
4. Rank them as likely drivers
5. How are they likely measuring this?
6. What are some potential issues that exist with it?

## Situation

Playlists are the main unit in Spotify. According to Nielsen‚Äôs 2017 Music survey (Nielsen [2017](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11257-019-09237-4#ref-CR60 'Nielsen: Nielsen music‚Äî2017 report highlights. 
http://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/corporate/us/en/reports-downloads/2017-reports/us-music-360-highlights.pdf
(2017). Accessed Jan 2019')), almost three fourth (74%) of the music experience of the users is based on playlists. Furthermore, more than half of the survey respondents stated that they create playlists by themselves.

Spotify's playlists like 'songs to sing in the car' are algo driven and have some human curation (algotorial).

## What are Enhanced Playlists

Spotify is currently A/B testing an ‚Äòenhance‚Äô feature on playlists, both private, public, and collaborative playlists. The feature only shows up once you've added at least two songs to your playlist (and navigated away and returned to the playlist). "Enhancing" a playlist has Spotify every day algorithmically add songs to the playlist based on the songs you‚Äôve included in the playlist. Each of the songs Spotify adds have the enhance iconography, provide a quick + button to add the song to the playlist, or if you view more you can indicate you don't like the song. All the songs that you don't choose to keep will be replaced with new ones the next day.

Discover Weekly. Release Radar. Daily Mix N.

These are kind of like Daily Mix playlists but instead of based on some aggregate listening behaviour, it‚Äôs based on a select starting point you‚Äôve defined.

This is really like making a collaborative playlist but with the algo as your ever-helping friend. They make that pretty clear when you ‚Äúenhance‚Äù a collaborative playlist, adding spotify to the same list of contributors that you, or your other human collaborators would be in.

‚ÄúRadio‚Äù is a thing spotify has, but this is like define your own radio stations and let spotify do the building, still keeping the escape hatch where if you want to add your own (or remove a singular song they‚Äôve added) you most certainly can.

It interweaves the algo and your actions in a way that doesn‚Äôt currently exist in the spotify offering.

## Main points

- helps with the blank slate playlist creation issue
- gives each user algotorial power on their own playlists
- more artist exposure and improved discovery
- greater lock in and switching costs

### Blank Slate Problem

Spotify always had recommended songs for a playlist, these were likely not that actioned (or when they were actioned they often added, and subsequently not removed).

It adds this notion of time that doesn‚Äôt otherwise exists with your playlists - they were historically static and representative of moments in time, or genres, etc and to build on it was a pretty manual and painstaking endeavour.

There‚Äôs likely some consideration here about how to keep playlists fresh, what is the user behaviour like with an abundance of playlists, is more playlists better, is it better to spend more time building on fewer playlists.

But while early-adopter music enthusiasts might do their own playlisting, casual listeners need more guidance. Curation is the most important way streaming services can differentiate themselves, helping users discover music and keeping them engaged. These playlists drive the majority of listening, with only 36% of Spotify listening hours coming from user-generated playlists. \[4\] Perhaps curation can‚Äôt be solved by machines alone  
(https://digital.hbs.edu/platform-rctom/submission/thank-you-for-the-music-spotify-and-algorithmic-music-curation/) - what are the implications for peoples willingness to create playlists when they‚Äôre less empty voids? The blank page problem for the playlist - fixed by the helping hand of the algo.

It is the leverage in your playlist (curation) investment, for every 1 song you curate, spotify offers 10 to be curated.

More than 67% of the participants of the treatment group picked at least one recommended track for inclusion in their playlists(https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11257-019-09237-4)
Looking at the time required to complete the entire playlist creation task shows that the users who used recommendations needed, on average, one and a half minutes less (6.31¬†min) than those without recommendation support (8.03¬†min). The difference is however only marginally significant (ùëù\=0.07p\=0.07). At the same time, the participants who used recommendations‚Äîand needed less time‚Äîcreated longer playlists, with an average size of 9.38 versus 8.77 for the others.

It's important to note how similar recommendations were always available at the bottom of playlists, etc this is fundamentally a different behavior paradigm, essentially the opt-in vs. opt-out

### Each User Algotorial

Playlists can represent fine grained themes and this is the even finer grain of theme, and personalized. This is what algo unlocks to a degree that‚Äôs otherwise impossible - especially given the raw volume of music that exists.

Why settle for one discover weekly, when you can have an infinite number of discover weeklies based on your diverse tastes or feelings - 10 songs for playlist A, 10 for B, etc.

Effort can be applied to filtering and selecting, not on hunting or gathering outside of when you want to gather.

Spotify enhanced collaborative playlists let spotify generate new music based on your groups collective tastes

I had a friend who followed my discover weekly - he wanted to be introduced to more songs like my taste in music - now imagine that you can create fine-grained auto discovery based on a unique combination of genres that captures that one cottage weekend, or a vibe thats uniquely yours.

editorial intent, user intent, - create playlists to fit moods, emotions, situations, etc

personalization within playlists - editorial playlists were better at capturing human emotions and tapping into the zeitgest (a ugc playlist is like that but just for you so on steroids) but limited because it had to be everyone

algo playlists cater to individual but lack depth and understanding of the situation ( with enhanced playlists the existing songs, title, etc of playlist add that situational depth)

best approach for combining editorial and personalization was to think of algo and all the data as input into editorial decisions when making playlists to build rest of playlist (this is like the ‚Äòheres some songs you might like to add‚Äô feature)

you define the playlist (the situation you want to listen to music in, your own unique little genre definition) and the algo defines what should populate it based on your tastes.

people opening playlists indicating desire based on naming and what not, but then didnt play becuase the songs (track list) didnt match their interpretation of that playlist definition

meg built the 700 track candidate pool (widening it and selecting the list of songs to select from) and then to sequence used the personalization so the algo picked from those 700

‚Äúalgotorial‚Äù (algorithmic + editorial) but now you‚Äôre the editor and its not a candidate pool but more of a starting point.

you as the playlist creator choose to ‚Äúaccept‚Äù songs into your playlist based on the enhanced recommendations - this provides a feedback loop for the songs that fit (reinforcement learning) .

### Greater Artist Exposure & Overall Improved Discovery

The latest [research from MRC Data/Nielsen Music](https://www.billboard.com/articles/business/streaming/9457753/consumers-streaming-music-discovery-music-360/?utm_source=Sailthru&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Digital%20Update&utm_term=biz_digital) highlights that 62% of people surveyed said streaming services are among their top music discovery sources while ‚Äújust‚Äù 54% named friends and family

By 2016, Spotify claimed that it had produced over 4,500 editorial playlists which collectively generated one billion streams per month (Spotify [2016](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17530350.2019.1708780#)).
With tens of millions of followers, Spotify‚Äôs editorial playlists now reach a broader audience than most radio stations ‚Äì even in large markets such as the U.S. It therefore comes as no surprise that Spotify currently describes its editorial playlists as its ‚Äòtop real estate‚Äô (e.g. Spotify [2019b](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17530350.2019.1708780#)) and continuously imposes new measures to expand their reach and influence.
For instance, Spotify has argued that getting featured on its editorial playlists is ‚Äòas simple as making sure your music is on Spotify,‚Äô and stressed that its algorithmic music recommendation system ‚Äòrecommends artists of all sizes‚Äô (Spotify [2016](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17530350.2019.1708780#)); thereby suggesting that its machine-generated editorial playlists are at once smooth, egalitarian, and non-discriminatory.

This basically makes user created playlists have some of the value that spotify gets from editorial playlists

https://music-tomorrow.com/2020/10/understanding-music-discovery-algorithms-how-to-amplify-an-artists-visibility-across-streaming-platforms/ - "As Milena Taieb, Global Head of Trade Marketing and Partnership at Believe, has pointed out during our interview: 68% of total streams are user-driven ‚Äî streaming from their library, their own playlists or searching for their favorite albums or artists. 14% of streams are algorithmic driven, and 10% editorial driven. This is far from Youtube‚Äôs 70% algorithm-mediated consumption share, but that doesn‚Äôt make algorithms any less important. **To get added to the user‚Äôs library or personal playlist, the artist needs to get discovered by said user first ‚Äî¬†and it‚Äôs editorial and algorithmic playlists that will often help get them there.**"
![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_1D2XflByNm_Odw38rTllF6KJUWj-k8KmCH9J4fVu_CsZ3kPDJyhwwvyqJKnXv6kxxANJONcGwsYsSTMY3f_03F8zTmg94bSK7mJ4k4bFkME0Jq_QBUTUbEJxOPydng-JysKvAEW 'Chart')
_From where do people stream? Believe Digital data, 2020_

the goal is to move the listener from ‚Äúpassive‚Äù streams (originating from algorithmic or editorial playlists) to ‚Äúactive‚Äù, user-driven streaming - this is made much easier when you put the song in the playlist and it's just a single + button away.

Spotify‚Äôs editorial playlists are increasingly used as a type of crystal balls that can help discern everything from the next big hit, to the decline and demise of popular music. For instance, Nick Holmsten ‚Äì formerly Spotify‚Äôs head of shows and editorial ‚Äì once claimed that by digging into playlist data, he can predict which song will be a hit in half a year‚Äôs time (Pierce [2017](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17530350.2019.1708780#)).
Spotify‚Äôs ongoing experiments with editorial playlists can also be understood as a strategic means of tending to relationships within the wider music industries, since control over editorial playlists gives Spotify leverage and bargaining power in negotiations with rights holders.
In March 2019, for example, Spotify did precisely such a thing when it announced that it would expand the number of editorial playlists that are assembled by algorithms (Spotify [2019f](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17530350.2019.1708780#)). This change was publicly presented as an effort to cater to the requests of independent musicians, who have long called for more diversity in Spotify‚Äôs editorial playlists.Legitimized by Spotify's internal research ‚Äì which had shown that algorithmically generated playlists ‚Äòincrease the number of artists featured on playlists by 30% and the number of songs listeners are discovering by 35%‚Äô (ibid.)

We thus asked the participants if the recommendations helped them _discover_ such tracks and artists. As shown in Fig. [10](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11257-019-09237-4#Fig10), 55% of the participants who used the recommendations stated that the recommender provided relevant tracks they did not know, and 49% answered that it provided relevant artists they did not know.

### Increased User Investment (read: increased Switching Costs)

Furthering the view of Spotify as the music-focused friend everyone has - the more trusted Spotify becomes in that role in peoples lives the larger the moat.

In the spotify podcast they talk about how they benefited from people building their libraries, curating them, etc as people locking themselves in with their own time investment. This is a way for spotify to double down on your own investment - not only are you now invested in the songs you‚Äôve added, the playlists you‚Äôve created, but each of the playlists you create is now ‚Äúliving‚Äù, and to move that playlist somewhere else, say Apple Music means to kill it, it no longer lives, and it‚Äôs purely static unless you manually add to it.

---

So what behaviour are they trying to drive?

- more curation
- more investment in playlists
- extend the recommendation relationship
- refine the recommendation relationship

And how will they measure it?

- Playlists created just for enhancing (determined likely by a playlist created and enhanced within a certain timeframe, or playlists created post end user enhanced awareness and then enhanced)
- Listening time to playlists that are enhanced
- Songs saved to playlists from enhanced recommendations
- variety in playlists that get enhanced (based on the underlying song composition)
- What is the ratio of existing playlists enhanced or new ones?
- Songs that come from an enhancement that get added to liked songs
- what about new artists discovered?
- What is the avenue of feedback here for ML? What level of feedback does songs accepted into playlists provide for the future categorization of those songs?

Possible issues:

- recognition of a song to save (not visible when phone locked, etc)
- saving a song to liked songs as opposed to the playlist
- changes to the underlying playlist not causing a refresh of the enhanced song list
- providing the i dont like this feedback is very obfuscated
- no currently playing buttons to add to playlist only in song list which means scrolling to the find the currently playing song likely

We therefore conducted a user study involving 270 subjects, where one half of the participants‚Äîthe treatment group‚Äîwere provided with automated recommendations when performing a playlist construction task. We then analyzed to what extent such recommendations are adopted by users and how they influence their choices.

When considering the question of what is better, algorithms or curation - Google the data set is infinite (which means no human is capable of doing the job), but the target is finite. FB - the amount of information any one user will ever be interested in is finite; what is infinite are the number of targets.
I‚Äôm excited about the real user benefit that can come from balancing algorithms and curation: while Facebook and Google rightly focus on algorithms only, most content is best delivered by a mixture; getting that mixture right will likely prove to be both massively popular and massively valuable.
Consider new users - it's highly likely they start out building playlists - this is a huge way to accelerate their entry into spotify - again this is the leverage point.

- improves upon the playlist/radio seeding extending from one artist or song to many

### Improved Seeding

Perhaps the next step for the enhanced playlists is spotify giving you the starting point, a middle ground between discover weekly and enhanced playlists, I often don‚Äôt think to create playlists, I also really like the enhance aspect but I don‚Äôt often think to go and add the song I liked to the playlist when I hear it.

When people would recommend music, they had a chance to say why they thought I would like it. They could qualify the recommendation, which is something missing from playlists today.¬†(https://ericboam.medium.com/i-decoded-the-spotify-recommendation-algorithm-heres-what-i-found-4b0f3654035b) - this is interesting in considering that the existing songs in the playlist form this basis of explanation. Also music blogs were like playlists (some actually are now) and this is you crafting as many as you want of your own little music blogs.

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/329392345\_Music\_Recommendations\_Algorithms\_Practical\_Challenges\_and\_Applications - Last.fm seed track or seed artist (this is the radio option that exists, that spotify has also made more easily accessible, see newsroom of web/desktop redesign)
