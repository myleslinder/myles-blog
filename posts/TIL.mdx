RequestAnimationFrame runs in the spot in the event loop just before the rendering and painting actually happens and each callback in the queue gets called, but no callbacks added during this are called. Tasks run in the event loop on the "far side" of the loop and always happen after render, paint, etc and only a single Task is dequeued per cycle and no callbacks added this cycle are called. Microtasks happen every time the stack empties and the each cb in the queue gets called including cbs added during the execution.
